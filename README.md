# What's this then?

It was used to demonstrate test driven development (TDD) during a lesson in a software development course. However, I am an impatient twat, so I went ahead and wrote it myself to see if it'd work as I expected.

# What the hell is FizzBuzz?

It's a [kids' game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) based around replacing a series of integers with arbitrary nonsense words (in this case "Fizz" and "Buzz" but alternatives are sometimes used as well) if they are divisible by arbitrary divisors (usually 3 and 5). It's often used in a software development context to check an individual's problem solving skills (e.g. in job interviews).

# Why should I care?

I dunno, but if you do, you can run `run_tests.py` in Python from a terminal to see that the tests pass, and you can open the individual modules inside the `src` and `tests` packages to see what it's doing. This was not designed to be an especially fancy or clever solution, just the absolute most basic one that would pass the very simple tests I wrote, in order to practice TDD.
